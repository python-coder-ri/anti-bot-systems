**Invisible CAPTCHA (reCAPTCHA v3)**

**Example:**

  • No visible challenge—works in the background.

  • Blocks suspicious traffic silently.
  
**Where you see it:**

  • High-security sites (banks, crypto exchanges).
  
**Looks like:**
    (Nothing visible, but console logs show: "reCAPTCHA score: 0.7")

**Bypass Methods:**

 • High-trust browser automation (undetected ChromeDriver).
 • Proxy rotation to reset low scores.
